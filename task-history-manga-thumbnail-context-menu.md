 # Task History: Manga Thumbnail Context Menu Implementation ## Objective Implement a new context menu and a dedicated 3-dot menu button for the thumbnail within the `Suwayomi-WebUI/src/modules/manga/components/details/Thumbnail.tsx` component, mirroring the functionality and implementation style of the existing "manga-card-action-menu". ## Plan 1. **Create New Component**: Create a new component, `ThumbnailOptionButton.tsx`. 2. **Integrate Components**: Integrate `ThumbnailOptionButton` and a new Material-UI `Menu` into `Thumbnail.tsx`. 3. **State Management**: Initialize a separate `PopupState` instance (`thumbnailMenuPopupState`) for the thumbnail's context menu. 4. **Positioning**: Position the `ThumbnailOptionButton` absolutely at the bottom-right of the thumbnail with an appropriate `zIndex`. 5. **Trigger Mechanisms**: Implement dual triggers for the context menu: *   Click on the `ThumbnailOptionButton` (using `bindTrigger`). *   Long-press gesture on the thumbnail itself (using the `useLongPress` hook). 6. **Menu Item**: Add an "Expand" `MenuItem` to the context menu that closes the context menu and then opens the existing fullscreen modal. ## Execution Summary 1. **Mode Switch**: Switched from `architect` mode to `code` mode to enable file creation and modification. 2. **Create `ThumbnailOptionButton.tsx`**: The new button component was created with the necessary imports and functionality, including a `MenuItem` to trigger the fullscreen modal. 3. **Modify `Thumbnail.tsx`**: *   Imported `ThumbnailOptionButton`, `Menu`, `MenuItem`, and `usePopupState`. *   Initialized `thumbnailMenuPopupState` for the new context menu. *   Added the `ThumbnailOptionButton` component, styled and positioned correctly. *   Integrated the `useLongPress` hook to trigger the context menu. *   Added the `Menu` component with the "Expand" `MenuItem`. 4. **Error Resolution**: *   The `useLongPress` hook import path was corrected. *   ESLint errors related to `bindTrigger` being unused were resolved by removing the import. *   TypeScript errors regarding `manga.id` being potentially undefined in `popupId` were handled by providing a fallback. *   Addressed ESLint formatting suggestions. ## Outcome The thumbnail now features a 3-dot button that, when clicked or when the thumbnail is long-pressed, opens a context menu with an "Expand" option. Clicking "Expand" correctly triggers the fullscreen modal, similar to the manga card's context menu functionality.
